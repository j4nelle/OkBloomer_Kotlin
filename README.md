# OkBloomer
OkBloomer is an application that helps you manage the water needs for your plants. 

Add as many plants as you have at home, give them nicknames and provide the watering frequency for them (how many days should you have between two waterings) and the app will send you notifications when it's time to water your plants ! 

You can also access recognition of your plant's specie when you have a doubt thanks to the API of PlantNet by simply adding a picture of your plant. 

When you want to add a new plant to your collection, the app also give you access to the nearest plant shops thank to the integration of Google Maps.
